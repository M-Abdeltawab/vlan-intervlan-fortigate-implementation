# VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing with FortiGate

## Project Overview

This project documents the end-to-end process of implementing a segmented network. The work involves configuring VLANs on a network switch to create logical partitions and subsequently deploying a FortiGate firewall to perform secure inter-VLAN routing. The final outcome is a functional and tested network architecture with comprehensive documentation.

## Project Phases & Deliverables

### Week 1: VLAN Configuration Basics
- **Objective:** Establish foundational VLAN segmentation on a network switch.
- **Key Activities:** Creating VLANs, assigning access ports, and documenting the initial design.
- **Deliverable:** VLAN configuration document and network diagram.

### Week 2: FortiGate Integration for VLANs
- **Objective:** Configure the FortiGate firewall to route traffic between VLANs securely.
- **Key Activities:** Setting up VLAN interfaces, defining static routes, and implementing firewall policies to control inter-VLAN traffic.
- **Deliverable:** FortiGate VLAN configuration and firewall policy documentation.

### Week 3: Advanced VLAN Features and Testing
- **Objective:** Finalize the network connectivity and validate all functionality.
- **Key Activities:** Implementing VLAN trunks between the switch and firewall, and conducting thorough tests of VLAN-to-VLAN communication.
- **Deliverable:** Testing report with results and final configuration details.

### Week 4: Presentation and Final Report
- **Objective:** Synthesize all work into a cohesive summary for review.
- **Key Activities:** Compiling all previous deliverables into a final report and creating a presentation slide deck.
- **Deliverable:** Final Report and Presentation.
